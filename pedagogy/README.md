## 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Instrumentation & Practical skill, Data analysis

<br/>
By this experiment we want users to understand the concept of change in stability of vitamin C with varying temperature. By doing this experiment they would enhance their practical skills and they would themselves analyze the effect of temperature on vitamin C content of various fruit/vegetable juice samples. 
<br/>
<br/>

## 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level
<br/>
<b> Description </b><br>
Here we have identified five learning objectives. As the experiment gives the knowledge about the variation in vitamin C content in different food samples with change in temperature, therefore it includes remembering of the pre-learnt concept of sample preparation and then understanding the new concepts of standardization of dye. Further during the experiment, user will be able to perform the titration process and based on the observed data users will be able to examine vitamin C content and determine the effect of temperature on vitamin C content of the sample. <br>
<br/>
<b> Method</b>
<br/> To achieve attainment of all the objectives, the experiment is designed to determine heat stability of vitamin C of different juice samples, so that students may learn through performing.
