### About the Experiment 

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient in the diet, but is easily reduced or destroyed by exposure to heat and oxygen during processing, packaging, and storage of food. The instability of Vitamin C makes it more difficult to ensure an accurate listing of Vitamin C content on the nutrition label. The official method of analysis for Vitamin C determination of juices is the 2, 6-dichloroindophenol titrimetric method. Ascorbic acid reduces the indicator dye to a colorless solution. At the endpoint of titrating an ascorbic acid containing sample with dye, excess unreduced dye is a rose-pink color in the acid solution. The titre value of the dye can be determined using a standard ascorbic acid solution. Food samples in solution then can be titrated with the dye, and the volume for the titration used to calculate the ascorbic acid content.
